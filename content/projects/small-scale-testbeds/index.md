This project aims to advance the development of small-scale testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and robot swarms.

The design and validation of algorithms for CAVs or robot swarms often necessitate computer simulations and/or full-scale experiments. Small-scale testbeds aim to combine the merits of both to enable rapid prototyping while approximating real-world conditions more closely than mere simulations.

Below are a list of endeavors we have undertaken.

## Endeavor 1
We organized *1st Workshop on Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms* at the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2024), Jeju, South Korea ([website](https://cpm-remote.lrt.unibw-muenchen.de/iv24-workshop)). We summarized our workshop outcomes in the paper *Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms: Challenges and a Roadmap* [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05656).

## Endeavor 2
We wrote a survey paper *A Survey on SmallScale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms* ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14199) / [IEEE Xplore](https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2024.3505772)). Additionally, our paper features an online table comparing more than 25 existing testbeds ([see here](https://cpm-remote.lrt.unibw-muenchen.de/testbeds)).
